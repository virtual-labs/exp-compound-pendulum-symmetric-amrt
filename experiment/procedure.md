## Procedure

### Performing the real lab

The compound bar pendulum AB is suspended by passing a knife edge through the first hole at the end A.  The pendulum is pulled aside through a small angle and released, whereupon it oscillates in a vertical plane with a small amplitude. The time for 10 oscillations is measured. From this the period T of oscillation of the pendulum is determined.
