### Aim of the experiment
To determine: 
<ul>
<li>The acceleration due to gravity (g) using a compound pendulum.</li>
 <li>The radius of gyration (k<sub>G</sub>) of the compound pendulum about an axis perpendicular to the plane of oscillation and passing through its centre of mass.</li>
 <li>The moment of inertia (I<sub>G</sub>) of the compound pendulum about an axis perpendicular to the plane of oscillation and passing through its centre of mass.</li>
</ul>
